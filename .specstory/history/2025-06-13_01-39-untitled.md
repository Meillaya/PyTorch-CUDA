Now make a file in the docs/ folder fully documenting all the background computer theory behind the idea (CUDA, pytorch, PTX bare metal GPU coding etc.) the theory behind the code implementation, expaining the code implementation itself, the math and computer theory behind some of the troubleshooting and why the final implementation ultimately suceeded. Your writeup should be at least 1000 words, use some latex for math equations if necessary and perform any web research if necessary. Begin with the background of why someone would even want to make a project like this and the theory behind the hypothesis. Include citations and references in the text from arxiv papers and academic papers where relevant, list them at the bottom in a refernces section. Do extensive research. DONT USE ANY EMOJIS, wrap latex equations and math properly.

I'll help you create a comprehensive documentation file for your PyTorch-CUDA project. Let me first explore the codebase to understand the project structure and implementation, then conduct research to write a thorough technical document.
